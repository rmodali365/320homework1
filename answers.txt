What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
When you merge two branches you are combining the changes of both branches into one merge commit. This preserves the commit history and makes it easy for collaboration. Rebasing a branch onto another makes it seem like you were making changes to that same branch all along; it makes for a cleaner more linear commit history.
